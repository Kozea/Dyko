History
```````

Lightweight markup languages were originally used on text-only displays which could not display characters in `italics`_ or `bold`_, so informal methods to convey this information had to be developed. This formatting choice was naturally carried forth to plain-text email communications.

1986 international standard `SGML`_ provided facilities to define and parse lightweight markup languages using grammars and tag implication. The 1998 W3C `XML`_ is a profile of SGML that omits these facilities.
