A lightweight markup language
`````````````````````````````

A **lightweight markup language** is a `markup language`_ with a simple syntax, designed to be easy for a human to enter with a simple `text editor`_, and easy to read in its raw form.

Lightweight markup languages are used in applications where people might be expected to read the document source as well as the rendered output. For instance, a person downloading a software library might prefer to read the documentation in a text editor rather than a browser.
